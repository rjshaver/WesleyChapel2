                        Nikki-Raye Rice is a native of Hickory, North Carolina. She didn’t grow up going to church, but by her teenage years she found herself participating in a church-van ministry.  It was as a teenager that she powerfully experienced the grace of God in Jesus Christ and responded.  Since then she has been on a journey of discipleship with Jesus, one filled with both great sorrows and immense joys, a journey of discipleship that has led her to a call and vocation to pastoral ministry. Nikki Raye is deeply passionate about the tender love and mighty power of God-Father, Son, and Spirit-to heal and transform her own life, other people’s lives and the whole world.

                    Jane was born and raised in Stanly County to Christian parents who loved music. Her dad sang with the 600 member choir at the Billy Graham Crusade in Charlotte in the late 50’s and this inspired her with a love for hymns and church music. To serve the Lord with gladness and praise Him with music is Jane’s desire.
