			<h2>Who We Are</h2>
			
			<p>The United Methodist Church is:</p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Global:</strong> Today we speak many languages and live in many countries—with different cultures, ethnic traditions, national histories and understandings of Christian faith and practice.</span></li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Connectional:</strong> Every United Methodist congregation is interconnected throughout the denomination via a unique, interlocking chain of conferences. The United Methodist Church practices representative democracy in its governance.&nbsp; Conferences elect delegates who are authorized to act and vote.&nbsp;</a>.</span></li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Inclusive:</strong> All persons are welcome to attend our churches and&nbsp;receive Holy Communion, and are eligible to be&nbsp;baptized and become&nbsp;members.</span></li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Grounded in Scripture: </strong>United Methodist trust free inquiry in matters of Christian doctrine. Our faith is guided by Scripture, tradition, experience and reason. Of paramount importance, however, is Scripture as the witness of God’s creating, redeeming and sustaining relationship with God’s people. </span></li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Wesleyan:</strong> The United Methodist Church has a Wesleyan heritage, and as such, places an emphasis on mind and heart (knowledge and vital piety) and putting faith and love into practice (life).</span></li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Concerned about social justice: </strong>For more than 200 years, The United Methodist Church and its predecessor bodies have expressed concern for God’s children everywhere — the poor, the orphaned, the aging, the sick, the oppressed and the imprisoned. <strong>.</strong></span></li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Mission-oriented: </strong>Our mission is to make disciples of Jesus Christ for the transformation of the world. In uncomplicated terms, this means we strive to nurture followers of Christ who then reach out and teach others about the love of Jesus.&nbsp;</span></li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Ecumenical:</strong> United Methodists consider dialogue and missional cooperation between United Methodists and other Christians as a valid witness to the unity of the body of Christ.<br />
	</span></li>
</ul>
