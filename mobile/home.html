            <h1>Welcome to Wesley Chapel United Methodist Church</h1>
            <p>
                We are a Christ-centered community dedicated to making disciples. We love God, fully trust God with our lives, and live life by grace through faith. We also love and care for others as we share what <strong>Jesus Christ</strong> has done for us as our Lord and Savior.
            </p>
            <p>
                We hope that you will come and visit us in the wonderful village of Misenheimer, NC. We hope that you will begin to see why we love to call Wesley Chapel our church home. Maybe you’ll consider making Wesley Chapel UMC your “home” too!
