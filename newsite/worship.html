				<p>
					At Wesley Chapel, we worship God in many ways...
				</p>
				<p>
					Sunday mornings at 11:00 a.m. we gather to worship God in our sanctuary for a traditional service of hymns, prayers, liturgy, and fellowship as we hear God's word proclaimed.
				</p>
				<!-- Romoving second paragraph per John Bryant 6-1-15
				<p style="position:relative;top:-16px">
					Our pastor keeps things interesting! Sometimes the sermon will be delivered in a traditional manner, sometimes in a skit or drama, sometimes via stations that cause us to reflect on the scripture. We never know how she will choose to tell us what God has laid on her heart.
				</p>
				-->
				<p style="position:relative;top:-5px">
					We also have much talent in our church. We have a wonderful choir and many who sing specials. The music in our church varies from week to week as we worship God in song.
				</p>
				<!-- Removing paragraph per John Bryant 6-12-15
				<p>
					Bible Studies - We have Bible Study scheduled throughout the year. Studies have included 1 Corinthians, Controversial Topics, Lenten Studies, and more. We try to vary the days and times of study so that many can have opportunity to learn and worship God in a small group setting.
				</p>   -->
				<p>
					We worship God each time a group meets! We have an active group of United Methodist Women and United Methodist Men.  <!-- and United Methodist Youth (The Body Builders). -->  --> Each meeting is a chance for us to worship God as we learn more about our relationship with God.

					We are glad you have joined us today and pray that you will come our way again.
				</p>
				<p style="position:relative;top:-32px;text-indent:25px">
					Let us begin by telling you a bit about what we believe. We believe in revealed religion, experienced religion, and social religion.
				</p>
				<p style="position:relative;top:-48px;text-indent:25px">
					Revealed religion is how God has spoken to us through God's living Word, the Bible. God has spoken and we are called to hear and respond.
				</p>
				<p style="position:relative;top:-64px;text-indent:25px">
					Experienced religion is personal religion. This means more than just showing up on Sunday and going through the motions of ceremonies. It means that we fully trust God with our lives because Christ died for us. It means that we live a new and transformed life by grace through faith. We know that we are God's children now but that God's plan for humankind is not yet completed. We have much more to look forward to in God's heavenly Kingdom.
				</p>
				<p style="position:relative;top:-80px;text-indent:25px">
					Social religion connects us with other Christians in worship, study and prayer. We reach out to others by sharing our story of what Jesus Christ has done for us and by showing them deeds of mercy and love. By the Holy Spirit living within us, we are able to show "outward holiness" to those around us.
