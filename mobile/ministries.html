                    <span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Wesley Chapel is always involved in missions. As a church, we reach out into our community and help with programs such as the School Tools Drive in Stanly County, the Stanly County Christian Ministry Food Pantry, or collecting for a family burned out of their home. We believe in staying in touch with people in need and demonstrating Christ's love.</span>

                <p>
                    <span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The people in our church take John Wesley's words, "The World is my Parish," seriously too as they serve meals each week at the SCCM soup kitchen or deliver meals on wheels. Others use their time to visit shut-ins or stop by and make sure their neighbors are doing ok.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Our <a href="umwomen.html" target="_blank">United Methodist Women</a> and United Methodist Men are constantly helping others both in the community and across the globe. The men have cut wood and given it away to families who couldn't afford to heat their homes or buy wood. The women have sent money to all parts of the world in the hopes that others would come to know the Jesus that they know and serve.</span>

                <p>
                    <span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Even our youth are mission minded. At a church auction, they "sold" themselves for labor - to raise money just for missions! They raked leaves, cleaned houses and other tasks. They also purchased Snuggle Bears to give to people in our community that were in crisis. Our youth want others to know that Jesus loves them.</span>

					<span id="corrections">Our pastor helped us raise money for Pfeiffer's Cancer Walk by coloring her hair with some of the youth (pink and blue) if the church met it's goal! It didn't take long for the people to meet the goal - they wanted to see the preacher with funky hair!</span><br>

                    The church has sponsored mission trips, built Habitat houses, sent youth to camps they would not be able to afford - all in the name of Christ. Why not come and be a part of our mission-mindedness andgive us new ideas so that we can continue to be ever mindful of the mission that Jesus has called us to - to go into the world and make disciples - as we minister to others in His name.</span>
