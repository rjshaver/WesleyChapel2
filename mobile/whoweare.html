                <h2><u>Who We Are</u></h2>
                <p>The United Methodist Church is:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Global:</strong> Today we speak many languages and live in many countries—with different cultures, ethnic traditions, national histories and understandings of Christian faith and practice.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Connectional:</strong> Every United Methodist congregation is interconnected throughout the denomination via a unique, interlocking chain of conferences. The United Methodist Church practices representative democracy in its governance.&nbsp;
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Inclusive:</strong> All persons are welcome to attend our churches and&nbsp;receive Holy Communion, and are eligible to be&nbsp;baptized and become&nbsp;members.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Grounded in Scripture: </strong>United Methodists trust free inquiry in matters of Christian doctrine. Our faith is guided by Scripture, tradition, experience and reason. Of paramount importance, however, is Scripture as the witness of God’s creating, redeeming and sustaining relationship with God’s people.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Wesleyan:</strong> The United Methodist Church has a Wesleyan heritage, and as such, places an emphasis on mind and heart (knowledge and vital piety) and putting faith and love into practice (life).
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Concerned about social justice: </strong>For more than 200 years, The United Methodist Church and its predecessor bodies have expressed concern for God’s children everywhere — the poor, the orphaned, the aging, the sick, the oppressed and the imprisoned.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Mission-oriented: </strong>Our mission is to make disciples of Jesus Christ for the transformation of the world. In uncomplicated terms, this means we strive to nurture followers of Christ who then reach out and teach others about the love of Jesus.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Ecumenical:</strong> United Methodists consider dialogue and missional cooperation between United Methodists and other Christians as a valid witness to the unity of the body of Christ.
                    </li>
                    <br />
                </ul>

                <h2><u>What We Believe</u></h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>God:</strong> When we say the Apostles' Creed, we join with millions of Christians through the ages in understanding God as a Trinity—three persons in one: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li><strong>Jesus:</strong> We believe in the mystery of salvation through Jesus Christ. God became human in Jesus of Nazareth; and his life, death and resurrection demonstrates God's redeeming love.
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li><strong>The Holy Spirit:</strong> The Holy Spirit is God's present activity in our midst. When we sense God's leading, God's challenge, or God's support or comfort, it's the Holy Spirit at work.
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li><strong>Human Beings:</strong>Genesis 1:27 asserts that we've been made in the image of the Creator. Like God we have the capacity to love and care, to communicate, and to create.
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li><strong>The Church:</strong>The church is the body of Christ, an extension of Christ’s life and ministry in the world today.
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li><strong>The Bible:</strong>The Bible is God’s Word and is the primary authority for our faith and practice.
                    </li>
