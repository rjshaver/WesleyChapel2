                    <p>
                        Nikki-Raye Rice is a native of Hickory, North Carolina. She didn’t grow up going to church, but by her teenage years she found herself participating in a church-van ministry. It was as a teenager that she powerfully experienced the grace of God in Jesus Christ and responded. Since then she has been on a journey of discipleship with Jesus, one filled with both great sorrows and immense joys, a journey of discipleship that has led her to a call and vocation to pastoral ministry. Nikki Raye is deeply passionate about the tender love and mighty power of God-Father, Son, and Spirit-to heal and transform her own life, other people’s lives and the whole world.

                    <p>Jane was born and raised in Stanly County to Christian parents who loved music.

To serve the Lord with gladness and praise Him with music is Jane’s desire.
